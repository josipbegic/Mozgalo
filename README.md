# Mozgalo

Here you can read .pdf document and associated presentation about my project in Data mining competition Mozgalo. Unfortunately, associated workflow is too big (>2GB) to be put on github, but can be sent via other platforms on demand (just send mail to josip44@hotmail.com or josipbegicLA@gmail.com)
